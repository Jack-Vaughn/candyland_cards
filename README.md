# Candyland Cards Written in Dart/Flutter

This Candyland Cards should be able to run on Android, iOS, Web, Mac OS, and soon, Linux and Windows.

My children love playing the game Candyland, but always have trouble flipping over the cards. Either they move the whole deck, or they draw 5 cards at once. What easier way to play other than tapping a phone screen?
